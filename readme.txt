Deejay is an accessible, responsive theme for musicians, DJ's and event planners.

== Description ==
Deejay was designed with musicians, DJ's and event planners in mind. 
The theme is accessible and responsive with multiple menus and widget areas as well as color and layout options, 
including support for a header background video. Deejay has 3 custom widgets for recent posts, 
recent comments and testimonials (The testimonial widget requires Jetpack).
It also uses the audio and video post formats so that you can showcase your music,
and includes a custom post template that lets you hide the author, categories and tags.

Deejay is built to be used with these optional plugins:
Events Manager, WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads and Jetpack,
so that you can present your events, sell merchandise, share content or display your portfolio and testimonials. 

Demo: deejay.wptema.se

== Installation ==
	
1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Important Notes ==

The header widget area is only visible on the front page and only has room for 3 widgets.
The header on the front page is only as big as your header image.
If your header image is too small, your header widgets will not show.
The space is somewhat limited, so carefully select widgets that will fit inside the area.
If you add a video, the header image will be used as a fallback while the video loads.

The social menu does not show submenus.
I recommend a short site title and max 3 or 4 header menu items for the logo, title and menu to align properly.

The theme is responsive and by default it displays a simplified,
scaled down front page on mobile phones and tablets to reduce loading times and to 
make it easier for the user to access the content directly.

* At 960px width, only the first header widget will be shown.
* At 780px width, the header image, the custom header menu, and the header widgets are hidden. 
The logo, site title and the navigation bar are still visible.

If you want to display the full header content on mobile phones and tablets, 
go to the customizer, select the Theme Options panel, and select the advanced mobile header option.
Because the header image is much smaller on mobile devices, 
the widgets will be displayed below the header image, above the content.

The number of items that are shown in the top navigation bar depends on the screen size. 
To view the full menu, press the menu icon that appears on the left hand side.

The testimonial widget requires the Jetpack plugin. https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/
Other recommended plugins:
Events Manager https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/

== To do ==
Update WooCommerce css to better match the theme colors.
Add WooCommerce cart to the menu.
