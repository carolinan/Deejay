Important Notes:
The header, including site title, description, header menu and header widgets, is only visible on the front page.
Only 3 widgets will be shown in the header widget area.
At 960px width, only the first header widget will be shown.
The mobile menu does not show submenus.
I recommend a short site title and max 3 or 4 header menu items for the title and menu to align properly.
